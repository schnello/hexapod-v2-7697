# Software

Software contain 2 parts, one is software of running on Linkt 7697 (an arduino C++ program), another is path generation (a python program).

* hexapod7697: an arduino program running on Linkit 7697
* pathTool: a python program that generate 3D points header, included by `hexapod7697`

## hexapod7697

Files/Folder | Description |
------------ | ----------- |
src/normal_mode | provide normal calibration (forward/backward/turn left/turn right/rotate/etc...) |
src/setting_mode | provide calirbration functions, to make sure servo is correctly aligned. |
src/linkit_control/ | UI control helper |
src/hexapod | hexapod class |
src/hexapod/hal | Hardware Abatraction Layer to running on Linkit 7697 |

> Note hexapod7697 use c++11 and STL, you may encounter problem if want to port it on pure Arduino platform.

#### Normal Mode UI
